# Website
This is just my personal website! It is built off of LiveTerm and designed to look and act like a terminal environment.
Hope you like it!

## Roadmap
In the future, I hope to add these things to the website
- [ ] A domain name and hosting (duh lol)
- [ ] A gui alternative if they want simpler access to the information 


## Credit
Thanks to [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm?tab=readme-ov-file) for the basis of the terminal environment.
